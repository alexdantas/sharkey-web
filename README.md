# saruman

A misterious project.

## Development

While developing this I bumped into several dead-ends.
These are the people/links who helped me a lot:

### Tools

* [tux: A console with direct access to Sinatras internal stuff](https://github.com/cldwalker/tux)

### Links

Sinatra general:

Data persistence:

* [Sinatra Recipes: DataMapper](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/models/data_mapper?#article)
* [Sam Stern: Making a Simple, Database-Driven website with Sinatra and Heroku](http://samuelstern.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/making-a-simple-database-driven-website-with-sinatra-and-heroku/)

Importing:

* [wooptoot: File Upload with Sinatra](http://www.wooptoot.com/file-upload-with-sinatra)
* [Random Ruby Thoughts: Upload Files in Sinatra](http://alfuken.tumblr.com/post/874428235/upload-and-download-files-in-sinatra)
